## YPFusuma

### Warning, This is a Fusuma fork and not ready for production (yet!)

Fusuma is a Swift library that provides an Instagram-like photo browser and a camera feature with a few line of code.  
You can use Fusuma instead of UIImagePickerController. It also has a feature to take a square-sized photo.

## Improvements
YPFusuma is built from the great Fusuma library.

Here are the improvements we added :
- Improve Overall Code Quality
- Simpler API
- Added Filters View ala Instagram
- Replaces icons with lighter Text
- Preselect Front camera (e.g for avatars)
- Scroll between tabs which feels smoother
- Grab videos form the library view as well
- Replaces Delegate based with callbacks based api
- Uses Native Navigation bar over custom View (gotta be a good UIKit citizen)
